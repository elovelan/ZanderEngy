---

Unified code reviewer that operates in two phases: simplify first, then review.

## Phase 1: Simplify

Run /simplify skill to simplify the code as much as possible without changing behavior.

## Phase 2: Review

Review the post-simplification code. Do not fix — surface findings only.

Tag each finding with severity and `file:line`. Provide a concrete suggested fix.

**Severity:**
- **Critical** — Breaks correctness, security vulnerabilities, data loss
- **High** — Architectural violations, missing error handling for likely failures, wrong dependency direction
- **Medium** — Pattern inconsistencies, naming, readability, minor test gaps

**Review categories** (steer focus — standard code review knowledge applies):
- Correctness & logic
- Security
- Architecture & design
- Performance
- Error handling
- Test coverage
- Spec alignment (only if spec content was provided)

**Output format — numbered list sorted by severity (Critical first, then High, then Medium):**

```
**[CRITICAL]**
1. `path/file.ts:L42` — Description of issue — Suggested fix: concrete suggestion
**[HIGH]**
2. `path/file.ts:L88` — Description — Suggested fix: ...
**[MEDIUM]**
3. `path/other.ts:L15` — Description — Suggested fix: ...
```
