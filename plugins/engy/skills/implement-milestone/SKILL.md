# Milestone Implementation Orchestrator

Orchestrate the implementation of an entire milestone by dispatching one agent per task. The orchestrator NEVER writes implementation code — it only gathers context, dispatches agents, validates results, and updates task status. Each agent uses `/engy:implement` for per-task TDD flow.

## MCP Tools

- `listTasks(projectId, milestoneRef, taskGroupId)` — find tasks for the milestone
- `listTaskGroups(milestoneRef)` — task groups within the milestone
- `updateTask(id, status)` — mark tasks `in_progress` / `done`
- `getProjectDetails(projectId)` — project paths (`specDir`, `projectDir`)

Use MCP to discover paths and task relationships, then Read/Glob/Grep for content.

## Core Principle

**The orchestrator is a pure coordinator.** It gathers context, plans execution order, dispatches team members, verifies their results, and updates task status. It NEVER writes or modifies implementation code itself. All implementation work happens inside subagents.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. `listTaskGroups(milestoneRef)` + `listTasks(milestoneRef)` — get the full task breakdown.
2. Look for the milestone plan doc: `Glob("{specPath}/m{N}-*.plan.md")`. Read it if found — this is the primary requirements source.
3. If no plan doc exists, read `{specPath}/spec.md` for overall context.

### Step 2: Discover Validation Commands

Read the project's **CLAUDE.md** to find all explicit validation and testing instructions. Extract two levels:

1. **Lightweight validation** — the commands each subagent must run before returning (build, lint, changed tests). Derive this from CLAUDE.md's quality gates and testing sections.
2. **Full validation** — the complete validation command set for final end-to-end checks after all tasks complete. This is whatever CLAUDE.md specifies as the pre-commit or CI gate.

### Step 3: Plan Execution Order

1. Map task group dependencies (a group is blocked if any of its tasks have `blockedBy` pointing to tasks in another group).
2. **Task groups execute sequentially** — process one group at a time in dependency order.
3. **Within each task group**, identify which tasks can run in parallel:
   - Tasks with no `blockedBy` dependencies on other tasks in the same group → **parallel** (dispatch as concurrent team members).
   - Tasks with `blockedBy` dependencies within the group → **serialized** in dependency order after their blockers complete.
4. Skip task groups where all tasks are marked `done`.
5. For groups with `in_progress` tasks, check existing work via `git status` and `git diff` before re-dispatching.

### Step 4: Process Each Task Group

For each task group, in sequence:

#### 4a. Dispatch Team Members

Mark all tasks in the group as `in_progress` via `updateTask(id, status: "in_progress")`.

**One agent per task.** For each task, spawn an agent with:
- Task title, description, and acceptance criteria
- Relevant section of the plan doc
- Validation commands to run before returning (from Step 2)
- File paths and pattern references relevant to the task
- Explicit instruction to commit changes before returning

**Parallelism:** If multiple tasks in the group have no mutual `blockedBy` dependencies, spawn them as concurrent team members in a **single message with multiple Agent tool calls**. Dependent tasks wait until their blockers complete, then get dispatched.

**Agent prompt template:**

```
Implement the following task using /engy:implement:

Task: {task title}
Description: {task description}

Plan context:
{relevant plan section}

Before returning, you MUST:
1. Run these validation commands and fix any issues:
   {lightweight validation commands from Step 2}
2. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.
3. Report back: what you implemented, what you committed, any issues encountered.

Do NOT modify files outside the scope of this task.
```

#### 4b. Process Results

As each team member returns:

1. Verify the agent reports a successful commit.
2. Mark the task as `done` via `updateTask(id, status: "done")`.
3. If the agent reports failure, decide: dispatch a fix agent or escalate to user.

### Step 5: Final Validation

After all task groups complete:

1. Run the **full validation commands** discovered in Step 2. Read complete output, verify explicitly — never assume success.
2. If issues are found:
   - **Batch related issues** (e.g., issues in the same file or same feature area) into groups.
   - Dispatch one fix agent per batch. Each fix agent receives: the issues to fix, validation commands, and instruction to commit before returning.
   - Fix agents follow the same validate-and-commit contract as implementation agents.
3. **Circuit breaker:** after 3 failed validation/fix cycles, stop and report to user with diagnostics (what failed, what was attempted, suggested next steps).

### Step 6: Report

Present a summary to the user:

1. **Tasks completed** — list of tasks and their commits.
2. **Validation results** — which gates were run and their results (pass/fail).
3. **Follow-ups** — any remaining issues, deferred feedback, or potential improvements.

## Key Principles

- **Orchestrate, never implement.** The orchestrator dispatches agents — it never writes code.
- **One agent per task.** Each task gets its own dedicated agent.
- **Task groups sequential, tasks parallel.** Groups run in order; independent tasks within a group run concurrently as team members.
- **Subagents validate and commit.** Each agent runs validation commands and commits before returning.
- **Commit before done.** Task status is only set to `done` after a successful commit.
- **Evidence before claims.** Run validation, read full output, verify explicitly.
- **Fresh context per agent.** Each team member gets a complete, self-contained task description with validation commands. Never assume shared context.

## Flow Position

**Previous:** `validate-plan` | **Next:** `review`

When all tasks are complete and passing, proceed with `/engy:review` for a final code review of all changes.
