# Software Requirements Specification

## Engy — v0.2

**Prepared by:** Aleks\
**Date:** 2026-03-01\
**Status:** In Review

***

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the complete requirements for Engy, an AI-assisted engineering workspace manager for spec-driven development. It covers all planned functionality from foundation through full autonomy (milestones M1–M11). This is the master SRS — child specs for individual milestones reference this document for shared context.

### 1.2 Scope

Engy is a single-user, local-first application providing a permanent home for ongoing engineering concerns (workspaces) and ephemeral scopes for bounded work (projects). It will:

* Manage multi-repo workspaces with knowledge persistence across projects

* Provide a rich spec authoring, planning, and review experience

* Orchestrate AI agents for autonomous code execution with human review gates

* Maintain a living knowledge layer (system docs, memory) that evolves with each completed project

* Integrate Claude Code CLI as the interactive action layer and Claude Agent SDK (via Mastra) for background autonomous execution

Engy will **not** provide: multi-user collaboration, GitLab/Bitbucket support, self-hosting distribution, or cross-workspace project coordination.

### 1.3 Definitions

| Term              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workspace         | A permanent entity representing an ongoing concern (codebase, product). Defines repo topology, holds shared knowledge, contains ephemeral projects.                                                   |
| Project           | An ephemeral execution scope tied to a spec. Lives in SQLite. Archived on completion.                                                                                                                 |
| Default Project   | A permanent scratchpad project auto-created per workspace for ambient work. Cannot be deleted or completed.                                                                                           |
| Spec              | A pre-project thinking space. A directory containing `spec.md` plus a `context/` subdirectory with supporting research.                                                                               |
| Vision Spec       | A foundational spec too large to execute as a single project. Serves as shared reference for child specs.                                                                                             |
| Milestone         | An organizational grouping of task groups within a project.                                                                                                                                           |
| Task Group        | A set of tasks that ship together as one PR. The unit of worktrees, branches, agent sessions, and parallelization.                                                                                    |
| Task              | An individual work item. Either `ai` (agent-executed) or `human` (manual checkbox).                                                                                                                   |
| Agent Session     | A persistent, resumable Claude Agent SDK instance tied to a task group or spec task.                                                                                                                  |
| System Docs       | The `system/` directory — the canonical, living description of what the system is right now.                                                                                                          |
| Shared Docs       | The `docs/` directory — user-created conventions, style guides, and organizational knowledge.                                                                                                         |
| Memory            | Structured knowledge that accumulates as work happens. Permanent memory subtypes: decision, pattern, fact, convention, insight. Fleeting (SQLite, temporary) or permanent (files in `.engy/memory/`). |
| Fleeting Memory   | A lightweight agent working note in SQLite — fast to create, triaged later. Temporary by nature.                                                                                                      |
| Project Memory    | A project-scoped decision or learning in SQLite. Evaluated for promotion to permanent memory on project completion.                                                                                   |
| Plan Content      | Milestone-level implementation plan stored in SQLite. Grows progressively as milestones are planned.                                                                                                  |
| SDD               | Spec-driven development — the core workflow loop: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement.                                                                                                                 |
| Pre-commit Gate   | A per-repo configured command that must pass before committing.                                                                                                                                       |
| Dev Container     | An optional per-workspace Docker environment for sandboxed agent execution with network firewall.                                                                                                     |
| MCP               | Model Context Protocol — the AI access layer exposing Engy data to Claude Code CLI.                                                                                                                   |
| ChromaDB          | Vector database used for semantic search across all Engy content (specs, docs, tasks, memories). Always rebuildable via `engy reindex`.                                                               |
| Mastra            | Agent SDK runtime for autonomous background agent execution. Provides agent lifecycle management, tool coordination, workflows, and memory integration.                                               |
| Claude Code Skill | A Claude Code CLI extension (e.g., `engy:spec-assistant`) that encapsulates a workflow — dynamic, pulling from system docs and memory. Not a static template.                                         |
| Terminal Panel    | The right-side xterm panel hosting Claude Code CLI, context-scoped per page.                                                                                                                          |
| Content Editor    | A BlockNote-based rich markdown editor for specs, docs, and memories.                                                                                                                                 |
| Diff Viewer       | The review and commit interface for code changes, scoped per task group.                                                                                                                              |

## 3. External Interface Requirements

### 3.1 User Interfaces

Two-panel layout on every page: main content area (left) + terminal panel (right). The terminal panel is resizable, collapsible, and tab-based. A persistent header provides breadcrumbs, global search, notifications, and settings. All primary actions live in the top-right action bar of the main content area.

**Responsive layout:** Desktop (>1024px) uses the two-panel layout. Tablet (768–1024px) collapses to single panel with terminal as slide-over. Mobile (<768px) uses single-column layout with terminal as full-screen overlay (floating action button to toggle). Mobile is optimized for monitoring and review (agent status, diffs, notifications, approvals) — heavy authoring (spec writing, planning) happens on desktop. Two-panel views (spec tree + editor, memory browser + detail) become sequential screens on mobile.

Pages: Home (workspace list), Workspace (tabbed: Overview, Specs, Docs, Tasks, Memory), Project (tabbed: Overview, Tasks, Plan, Diffs, PRs), Spec detail, Task detail (slide-out panel). See `context/ui-design.md` for full wireframes and responsive breakpoints.

### 3.2 Software Interfaces

| Interface         | Protocol         | Description                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| tRPC API          | HTTP (batch)     | Browser UI ↔ server. superjson transformer, httpBatchLink.  |
| MCP Server        | SSE + HTTP POST  | AI agents ↔ server. GET = SSE stream, POST = messages.      |
| WebSocket (`/ws`) | WS               | Server ↔ client daemon. Typed discriminated union protocol. |
| GitHub API        | HTTPS (via `gh`) | PR creation, CI status, reviewer comments.                  |
| Docker API        | Unix socket      | Client daemon ↔ Docker for container lifecycle (optional).  |
| ChromaDB          | HTTP             | Server ↔ ChromaDB for vector search indexing and queries.   |
| Claude API        | HTTPS            | Agent sessions ↔ Anthropic API for LLM inference.           |

### 3.3 Hardware Interfaces

Not applicable. Engy is a pure software application.

## 4. System Features

### 4.1 Workspace Management

**Description:** Workspaces are permanent entities representing ongoing concerns. They define multi-repo topology, hold shared knowledge, and contain ephemeral projects. Each workspace gets an initialized `.engy/` directory with standard structure.\
**Priority:** High

**Stimulus/Response:**

| Trigger                               | System Behavior                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User clicks "+ New Workspace" on Home | System presents creation flow: name, repo directories (with optional monorepo subdirectory scoping)                                                                                   |
| User submits workspace creation form  | System creates DB record, initializes `.engy/` directory (`workspace.yaml`, `system/`, `specs/`, `docs/`, `memory/`), creates Default project, validates repo paths via client daemon |
| User navigates to workspace           | System displays tabbed view (Overview, Specs, Docs, Tasks, Memory)                                                                                                                    |
| User opens workspace settings         | System displays repo configuration, agent config, notification overrides, terminal defaults                                                                                           |

**Functional Requirements:**

| ID      | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FR-1.1  | The system shall create a workspace with a name, auto-generated slug, and one or more repo directories.                                                                                          |
| FR-1.2  | The system shall support monorepo subdirectory scoping — repo entries can point to subdirectories within a repository.                                                                           |
| FR-1.3  | The system shall validate repo paths by sending `VALIDATE_PATHS_REQUEST` to the client daemon and receiving `VALIDATE_PATHS_RESPONSE`.                                                           |
| FR-1.4  | The system shall initialize a `.engy/` directory on workspace creation containing `workspace.yaml`, `system/` (with `overview.md` placeholder), `specs/`, `docs/`, and `memory/`.                |
| FR-1.5  | The system shall support a configurable `.engy/` location (global setting, default: `~/.engy/`, can point to any path).                                                                          |
| FR-1.6  | The system shall auto-create a Default project for each workspace that cannot be deleted or completed.                                                                                           |
| FR-1.7  | The system shall use compensating actions for workspace creation — if filesystem init fails, the DB row is deleted; if default project insert fails, both filesystem and DB row are rolled back. |

### 4.2 Spec Authoring

**Description:** Specs are pre-project thinking spaces. Users author specs in a tree browser with a rich content editor, manage context files, leave inline review comments, and track spec research tasks. Specs have a lifecycle from Draft through Approved.\
**Priority:** High

### 4.3 Project Planning

**Description:** Projects are created from approved specs. They contain milestones, task groups, and tasks. Planning is progressive — project-level first (milestones with rough scope), then milestone-level (groups and tasks), then optionally task-level (implementation plan). Three project views visualize execution state.\
**Priority:** High

| FR-4.10 | The system shall provide a WebSocket bridge between xterm frontend and CLI process on client machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| FR-4.11 | The system shall pass working directory, agent name, and scope metadata when spawning CLI processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| FR-4.12 | The system shall enforce read-only access outside the terminal's write scope — agents can search, read, and reference any workspace content via MCP tools, but direct filesystem writes are limited to the scoped directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### 4.5 Diff Viewer & Review

**Description:** The diff viewer is the review and commit interface for all code changes. Scoped per task group, it provides three view modes (Latest Changes, Commit History, Branch Diff), line-level commenting, and a batched feedback model (approve or send feedback). A pre-commit gate enforces quality before committing.\
**Priority:** High

**Stimulus/Response:**

| User clicks a line in the diff      | System opens inline comment input                                                                     |
| User clicks "Approve"               | System runs pre-commit gate → on pass, auto-commits                                                   |
| User clicks "Send Feedback"         | System batches all comments into structured markdown, routes to originating agent session or terminal |
| Pre-commit gate fails               | System surfaces errors for agent/user to fix                                                          |

| FR-5.7  | The system shall support a per-repo pre-commit gate command configured in workspace settings (e.g., `yarn blt`, `cargo test`).                                                                    |
| FR-5.8  | The system shall execute the pre-commit gate on the client daemon in the relevant worktree.                                                                                                       |
| FR-5.9  | The system shall use the same batched review model for document feedback (inline comments → approve or send feedback).                                                                            |
| FR-5.10 | The system shall compute diffs via the client daemon: working tree changes, commit diffs, and branch comparisons.                                                                                 |
| FR-5.11 | The system shall provide "Open in VS Code" buttons on diff viewer file tree items, task detail panels (worktree path), and project overview (repo paths) via `code` CLI.                          |
| FR-5.12 | The system shall provide a "Create PR" action in the Branch Diff view when the task group is in Review state.                                                                                     |

### 4.6 Execution Engine

**Description:** The execution engine manages worktrees, task group lifecycle, auto-commit, push, and PR creation. Task groups progress through a state machine from Planned through Merged/Cleaned Up. The engine orchestrates sequential task execution within groups.\
**Priority:** High

**Stimulus/Response:**

| FR-6.11 | The system shall broadcast task group state changes via WebSocket to the UI.                                                                                                                                         |
| FR-6.12 | The system shall allow task groups to reference repos outside the workspace when needed — workspace boundaries are organizational, not technical.                                                                    |

### 4.10 Dev Containers

**Description:** Optional per-workspace Docker containers provide sandboxed execution for async agents. Agents run with full permissions inside a network-firewalled container, eliminating manual permission approvals for unattended workflows.\
**Priority:** Low

**Stimulus/Response:**

| Trigger                                      | System Behavior                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Task group activates with containers enabled | Client daemon checks if workspace container is running; if not, builds/starts from Engy base image + workspace overrides |
| Last agent session completes                 | Idle timer starts; container stops after configurable timeout if no new sessions                                         |
| Agent makes network request                  | Firewall allows only domains in base allowlist + workspace-defined additions; all other traffic blocked                  |

| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| All files + active DB content | Filesystem + SQLite | `engy reindex` |

### 6.2 Data Retention & Migration

* **Active projects:** Full SQLite state retained until project is archived.

* **Archived projects:** Compacted — plan content, milestones, groups, task structure, key decisions, final statuses retained. Agent session state, fleeting memories, execution logs discarded.

* **Permanent knowledge:** Files in `.engy/` persist indefinitely, versioned via git.

* **ChromaDB:** Ephemeral — fully rebuildable from source files. No migration needed.

* **SQLite migrations:** Run automatically on server startup via Drizzle ORM. New migrations generated with Drizzle Kit after schema changes.

## 8. File Map & Implementation Sequence

***

## 9. Key Decisions

1. **Single-user first.** No authentication, no multi-tenancy. Architecture should support future multi-user without a rewrite, but it is not a design constraint today.

2. **Two AI runtimes.** Claude Code CLI for interactive work (terminal), Claude Agent SDK via Mastra for autonomous background execution. The split keeps interactive work snappy while heavy lifting runs in the background.

3. **Knowledge in files, execution in database.** `.engy/` files (git-tracked) hold permanent knowledge; SQLite holds transient execution state. ChromaDB indexes both but is always rebuildable.

4. **Server never touches user repos directly.** Path validation delegated to client daemon via WebSocket. Enables remote server deployment.

5. **Progressive planning.** Project → milestones (rough scope) → groups/tasks (detailed) → task-level plan (optional). Plan just-in-time with maximum context.

6. **Task groups as the shippable unit.** One worktree, one branch, one agent session, one PR per group. Regrouping after activation requires stop + re-plan.

7. **Batched review model everywhere.** Diffs and documents both use: review → comment → approve or send feedback. One model, two renderings.

8. **Specs are living documents.** Editable at any time during project execution. No artificial freezing.

9. **Short-lived project assumption.** Projects complete in days to weeks. Scope tightly, split large efforts, complete aggressively.

10. **Dev containers are optional.** The system works without containers (standard Claude Code permission model). Containers add network-firewalled sandbox for unattended agent execution.

## 12. Verification

> Milestone-level verification checklists live in each milestone's plan document. This section defines the system-level acceptance criteria.

1. `pnpm blt` passes (build + lint + test + knip + jscpd) at every milestone

2. Server test coverage meets thresholds: 90% statements, 85% branches, 90% functions, 90% lines

3. Full SDD loop functional end-to-end after M9: spec → project → plan → execute → review → commit → PR → complete

4. Knowledge feedback loop closed after M7: project completion → memory distillation → system doc updates

5. Terminal panel functional on every page after M4 with context-scoped auto-start

6. Dev containers (M10) optional — system works identically without them
