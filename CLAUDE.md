# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Engy is a single-user, AI-assisted engineering workspace manager for spec-driven development. It provides a permanent home for ongoing concerns (workspaces) and ephemeral scopes for bounded work (projects). Currently at Milestone 1 (Foundation) complete, Milestone 2 (Spec Authoring) in planning.

## Monorepo Structure

pnpm monorepo with Turborepo orchestration. Three packages:

- **`web/`** — Next.js 16 (App Router) + custom Node.js HTTP server. Contains both frontend UI and all backend services (tRPC API, WebSocket server, MCP server) on a single port.
- **`client/`** — Node.js daemon that runs locally on the developer's machine. Connects to `web/` via WebSocket. Handles path validation, file watching, and git operations.
- **`common/`** — Shared TypeScript types only (WebSocket protocol discriminated union). Zero runtime code.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start web + client concurrently (loads .dev.env)
pnpm build        # Build all packages
pnpm test         # Run all tests (Vitest)
pnpm lint         # ESLint + knip (dead code) + jscpd (copy-paste)
pnpm blt          # Pre-commit gate: build + lint + test + knip + jscpd

# Single test file
cd web && pnpm vitest run src/server/trpc/routers/workspace.test.ts
cd client && pnpm vitest run src/ws/client.test.ts

# Watch mode
cd web && pnpm vitest src/server/trpc/routers/workspace.test.ts
```

## Architecture

### Three Protocols on One Server

`web/server.ts` is the composition root. A single `http.Server` handles:
1. **Next.js** — all regular HTTP requests
2. **WebSocket** (`/ws`) — private channel to the client daemon
3. **MCP SSE** (`/mcp`) — AI agent access (GET = SSE stream, POST = messages)

### Server Never Touches User Repos Directly

The server sends `VALIDATE_PATHS_REQUEST` over WebSocket to the client daemon, which checks paths via `fs.access()` and responds with `VALIDATE_PATHS_RESPONSE`. This enables the server to run remotely while repos stay local.

### AppState Singleton on `globalThis`

`web/src/server/trpc/context.ts` stores shared state (`daemon`, `fileChanges`, `pendingValidations`) on `globalThis.__engy_app_state__` to survive Next.js hot module reloads. Tests reset this via `resetAppState()`.

### Dual API Surface

- **tRPC v11** (`/api/trpc/[...trpc]`) — for the browser UI. Uses `superjson` transformer, `httpBatchLink`.
- **MCP** (`/mcp`) — for AI agents (Claude Code CLI). Same domain operations exposed as MCP tools.

Both share the same DB and AppState but have separate implementations (acknowledged intentional duplication).

### Data Storage Split

- **SQLite** (Drizzle ORM + `better-sqlite3`) — execution state: workspaces, projects, milestones, tasks, memories. WAL mode. Lives at `{ENGY_DIR}/engy.db`.
- **Filesystem** (`{ENGY_DIR}/{workspace-slug}/`) — knowledge: `workspace.yaml`, `system/`, `specs/`, `docs/`, `memory/`. These are git-trackable markdown files.

### Database Schema Hierarchy

```
Workspace → Project(s) → Milestone(s) → TaskGroup(s) → Task(s)
                                                      → AgentSession(s)
                       → Task(s) (directly on project)
         → FleetingMemory(ies)
         → Comment(s) (by document_path)
Project  → ProjectMemory(ies)
```

Migrations run automatically on server startup via `runMigrations()` in `server.ts`. Generate new migrations with Drizzle Kit after schema changes.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Package | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ENGY_DIR` | web | `~/.engy/` | Data directory (SQLite DB + workspace dirs) |
| `PORT` | web | `3000` | HTTP server port |
| `ENGY_SERVER_URL` | client | `http://localhost:3000` | Server URL for daemon |

Dev overrides are in `.dev.env` (gitignored), which sets `ENGY_DIR=.dev-engy/` for project-local data.

## Testing

### Philosophy: Trophy Testing with BDD Style

Follow the Testing Trophy pattern — maximize vertical-slice integration tests that exercise real behavior through full call stacks, then fill in gaps with focused unit tests for edge cases. No mocks for the database; tests use real SQLite instances.

### Test Setup

All server tests use `setupTestDb()` from `web/src/server/trpc/test-helpers.ts`:
- Creates a temp directory, sets `ENGY_DIR`, runs migrations against a fresh SQLite DB
- Returns `{ db, state, tmpDir, cleanup }` — call `cleanup()` in `afterEach`
- tRPC tests create a caller via `appRouter.createCaller({ state: ctx.state })`

### Test Conventions

- BDD-style: `describe('router/feature') > describe('operation') > it('should ...')`
- Tests go next to the module they test: `workspace.ts` → `workspace.test.ts`
- Integration tests exercise full vertical slices (tRPC caller → DB → filesystem side effects)
- Unit tests fill gaps for pure logic (e.g., slug generation, cycle detection)
- No UI component tests currently

### Coverage Thresholds

Enforced in `vitest.config.ts` for `web/src/server/**`:
- Statements: 90%, Branches: 85%, Functions: 90%, Lines: 90%
- Excluded: migrations, schema.ts, test-helpers

## UI Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, all pages are `"use client"`
- shadcn components (lyra style, zinc base, no border radius)
- Tailwind CSS v4, JetBrains Mono font, remixicon icons
- Dark mode only (`className="dark"` on `<html>`)
- TanStack Query v5 + tRPC React Query (staleTime: 30s, retry: 1)
- `cn()` utility in `web/src/lib/utils.ts` for conditional class names

## Key Patterns

### Slug Generation
`generateSlug(name)` — lowercase, non-alphanumeric → hyphens, collapse consecutive, strip edges. Collisions resolved by appending `-2`, `-3`, etc.

### Workspace Creation (Compensating Actions)
Not atomic — uses compensating deletes: if filesystem init fails, DB row is deleted. If default project insert fails, both filesystem and DB row are rolled back.

### Cycle Detection
Iterative DFS via `detectCycle()` for task dependencies. Duplicated in both `routers/task.ts` and `mcp/index.ts`.

### WebSocket Protocol
Typed discriminated union in `@engy/common`. Message types: `REGISTER`, `WORKSPACES_SYNC`, `VALIDATE_PATHS_REQUEST/RESPONSE`, `FILE_CHANGE`. Only one daemon expected; second connection replaces first.

## Quality Gates

`pnpm blt` must pass before committing. It runs:
1. `turbo run build` — TypeScript compilation across all packages
2. `turbo run lint:eslint` — ESLint with strict unused-vars
3. `turbo run test` — Vitest with coverage thresholds
4. `knip` — dead code / unused exports detection
5. `jscpd` — copy-paste detection (threshold: 3 dupes, min 10 lines)

## Formatting

Prettier: semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas, 100 char width, 2-space indent.
